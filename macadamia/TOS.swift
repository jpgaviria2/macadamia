IMPORTANT NOTICE: THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE A MEDIATION-FIRST CLAUSE REQUIRING MEDIATION BEFORE ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE CASHU.ME.

ALL REFERENCES TO LAW, REGULATION, AND JURISDICTION IN THESE TERMS REFER TO THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE USERâ€™S JURISDICTION. USERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE LEGALITY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.

CASHU.ME DOES NOT HOLD ECASH, DOES NOT EXECUTE AND CANNOT MONITOR TRANSACTIONS, AND DOES NOT OPERATE OR VERIFY ANY MINTS.

These Terms of Service (these â€œTermsâ€) constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you (â€œyouâ€ or â€œyourâ€) and Cashu.me (â€œCashu.me,â€ â€œwe,â€ â€œus,â€ or â€œourâ€) regarding your use of the Cashu.me website and any related applications, software, code, or services (collectively, the â€œSiteâ€ or â€œServicesâ€). By accessing or using the Site or Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not access or use the Site or Services.

1. Nature of the Services

1.1 Non-Custodial Web Application: Cashu.me provides a non-custodial web application (â€œwalletâ€) that is executed entirely on your device. Our Site merely makes available client-side code implementing the open-source Cashu protocol. We do not run a server that holds your ecash or executes transactions on your behalf.

1.2 No Control Over Mints: Cashu.me does not issue ecash and does not operate or control any Mint. The choice of any Mint and any transaction or relationship you establish with that Mint is solely between you and that Mint. Cashu.me has no involvement, responsibility, or liability in any such interaction.

1.3 No Funds Access: At no time does Cashu.me have custody, possession, or control of your ecash. Transactions occur solely by your actions and through your chosen Mint. We do not monitor, verify, or facilitate transfers between you and any Mint or other parties.

1.4 Web Server Only: Cashu.me does not operate any servers except for the web server that delivers the application to your device. The application is executed entirely on your device. Once the code is served, all logic executes locally and Cashu.me has no control over the application.

1.5 Open Source Code: The application code is open source, meaning it can be self-hosted and run by third parties using different domains. Cashu.me has no control over, and does not endorse or assume responsibility for, any instances of the code running outside of the Cashu.me service. Your use of any such third-party instances is at your own risk.

1.6 Code Disclaimer: The open-source code is provided without any guarantee of security, error-free operation, or technical support. Users must independently verify the authenticity, security, and integrity of the open-source code prior to use.

2. User Responsibilities & Disclaimers

2.1 Userâ€™s Sole Responsibility: You understand and agree that you use the Site and Services at your own risk and for your own account. You alone are fully responsible for selecting Mints, conducting transactions, and safeguarding your ecash and secret values. Cashu.me is not a party to and disclaims any responsibility for any agreements, terms, or disputes between you and any Mint.

2.2 No Partnership with Mints: Cashu.me is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any Mint. We make no representations, warranties, or guarantees about any Mintâ€™s integrity, legality, liquidity, or functionality. Your relationship with any Mint, including the issuance, redemption, or valuation of ecash, is solely a matter between you and that Mint. Cashu.me is not a party to any transaction between you and any Mint or third party. No agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship is formed by your use of the Site.

2.3 Risk of Ecash: Ecash is an experimental, bearer-like digital asset that may not be recognized as money, currency, or a store of value. Anyone with the secret value has control over the ecash. You agree to review and understand all risks disclosed in our Risk Disclosure Statement before using ecash.
