**iMessage Extension ðŸ¤–**

This version of *macadamia* includes an iMessage Extension that lets you send ecash straight from the messages app ðŸš€.

Note: The recipient needs to also have *macadamia* installed to open the message. If they do not have it, 
send them a regular token using the main app's share sheet.

**Build 4** adds the option to select from a handful of banner images to be included with the ecash message! ðŸª„

**Input Conversion ðŸ’¶**

The wallet can now convert amounts to and from your preferred fiat unit. Select it in the Setting tab.

As always, thanks for using **macadamia**!
