**Multi Nut Payments ðŸŒ°ðŸ¥œðŸ”©**

This version of *macadamia* lets you perform lightning payments from more than one mint if it supports that feature.

The database inspector has also been improved for debugging.

**Hint:** If one or more mints are not shown as supporting MPP (Multi-path payments) pull down on the main mint list to update all.


As always, thanks for using **macadamia**!
