This is the new **macadamia version 0.2.0!**

It has been completely rebuilt using the newest technologies and APIs of the üçé ecosystem to allow for many cool features in the future.
For now this application is still being developed, please use responsibly.

To move you balance from the old macadamia, use the `Drain Wallet` feature.

Contributions and feedback are always welcome and can be submitted via GitHub or email (see settings tab).
