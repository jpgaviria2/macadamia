**Bug Fixes and other improvements**

This version of **macadamia Wallet** features numerous minor bug fixes and improvements:
- Correct scanning of QR codes containing a token with URI prefix ("cashu:")
- Better reliability when creating QR codes
- Mint view now polls the mint to check whether the invoice was paid

The current build also includes a version of the `CashuSwift` library that performs DLEQ verification to prevent fingerprinting from a malicious mint. ðŸ”Ž
____
**Build 4** now lets you swap a token to one of your trusted mints instead of adding it. â†”
